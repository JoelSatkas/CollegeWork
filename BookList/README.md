A booklist app I made in 2014 for a college module.  
The app keeps track of lecturers and their books and allows CRUD operations on them.  
It can also calculate the yearly book payment and output its information to a text file  
This app demonstrates the use of the Java language and some basic object oriented techniques as well as custom made data structures.
